### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer from Rio de Janeiro, with more than 10 years of experience, currently working as a Business Analyst at Dataprev, a Brazilian public IT company responsible for processing Latin America's biggest public pension payroll.

After a long (longer than expected) period trapped in the managing roles, I'm currently returning to the technical duties, tackling on some side projects, like my favorite, Model Canvas, which I expect to release some time this year.

Technology was always easy to process for me, and this trait enabled me to understand fairly well a lot of frameworks and languages in the day, and now, in my return to the programming side of things, this has proven to be a immense advantage, allowing me to navigate the extreme complex and unstable javascript ecosystem with ease while mantaining my sanity along the way.

In the past I was interested in blockchain technologies, like Ethereum, Hyper Ledger and Corda, and did quite well, with some important projects developed within the company, like the fabled bCPF, one of the largest blockchain projects, aimed at the public database of Brazilian Citizens, mantained by the Brazil equivalent of IRS (Internal Revenue Service), the Receita Federal do Brasil.

Feel free to add me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlostosta/) and drop a message if you want to discuss something or just talk.

Last but not least, I'm avaliable to play Monster Hunter ðŸ‘€ on Xbox (@jctosta) and Steam (@astot), drop a chat and let's get some fun.
